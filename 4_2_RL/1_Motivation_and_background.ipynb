    "\n",
    "We can make the claim that a wide class of problems can be formulated as graph search more precise by considering that many problems can be construed in terms of the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a __state space__, a set of __states__, or \"configurations\" in which we are searching for a solution.\n",
    "- There is an __initial state__ in the state space, a starting point for exploring options.\n",
    "- In each state, there is a finite set of __actions__ (moves, operations) that can be made, and each of these actions leads to new -- not necessarily different -- states.\n",
    "- Moving from one state to an other using an action can be associated by an __action cost__, e.g., the time of the action.\n",
    "- Last, but not least, there must be a set of __goal states__, which are the solution(s) of the problem. This set can be specified simply by enumeration  or by a property which a state has to satisfy to be a goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a __solution__ in this framework? \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is not simply the goal state, which may be explicitly given, but a __path, i.e., a sequence of state transitions by way of actions leading to a goal state from the start state__. \n",
    "- An __optimal__ solution is a solution with the minimum total action cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this type of formulation reduces a problem, however different it seems, to a __search task in a directed and weighted graph__:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the __nodes__ of the graph are the __states__, i.e., the elements of the __state space__,\n",
    "- the __directed edges__ correspond to concrete transitions that can be carried out by the available actions, and the \n",
    "- __edge weights__ are the costs associated by the state transition corresponding to the edge in question."
