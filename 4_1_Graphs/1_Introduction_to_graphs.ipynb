    "# What is a graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is a flexible unordered data structure representing entities and their relations in an informative and compact manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main components of graphs are:\n",
    "- __Nodes__ (also called vertices, or vertex in singular) are the main objects or entities, for which the connections are to be represented\n",
    "- __Connections__ (also called edges) are representing the presence or absence of certain pre-defined relations amongst the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Jjj3q6vsxlsps2ryKeFSFB4xKzT6CWhq\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Ic693TA57v3X0S-VlzcG5UYMC6MCNJQp\" width=35%></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are very general and flexible, and are utilized nearly ubiquitously in many domains. They are considered unordered, since (without further restrictions) do not represent any global ordering, so they can be __\"traversed\"__, in multiple ways, following along their connection structure \"step by step\", where in a given step we start from a node, and \"travel along\" a given edge to arrive at another vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing additional restrictions on graphs can lead to other previously discussed datastructures, like __trees__, which are basically __special cases of graphs__ in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also considerable amount of flexibility about __what constitutes a vertex__, and __what number and type of connections are allowed__. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Typology of graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this flexibility, we can try to set up a rough typology of graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Directedness\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://www.differencebetween.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DifferenceBetween_Directed_UnDirected_Graphs1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1IYF82f-fpZ-FtqDiLtKtVrD6EOXhaLrN\" width=35%></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the edges in the graph, we can define __directed__ or __undirected__ graphs, whereby in the first case, we also store the __\"origin\"__ and __\"destination\"__ information of an edge, but in the second case, we leave this property undefined, signifying only the presence of a mutual connection. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Maximum degree\n",
    "\n",
    "Also noteworthy attribute of a graph is the number of allowed number of connections per node, also called __degree__.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a general graph there are no restrictions on how many nodes can connect to each-other, hence the maximum number of connections is $n-1$ in case of $n$ nodes, forming a [complete graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph). \n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Complete_graph_K7.svg/400px-Complete_graph_K7.svg.png\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ekz9zEuni1E1R-5CBdZyOaeWtjkuAXCA\" width=35%></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The other extreme case would be to restrict the nodes to have only maximally one edge, but that typically does not make too much practical sense, so more often the restriction is set to eg. two. Remember those binary trees? They are graphs restricted to degree two, and with a dedicated root node. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*PCwTxonbP0rBNp0R8fSZ1Q.png\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1K7ZzOaI43pWw-d4i5O90z4_27r26ePNJ\" width=35%></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of connections\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also considerable amount of variance with respect to the number and types of connections between give two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question is, if we allow __multiple connections between the same two nodes__.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Multi-pseudograph.svg/1200px-Multi-pseudograph.svg.png\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1C5OduXkAAguIARxwJG0PfoeCkb5XXV21\" width=35%></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we allow multiple connections, we get to a [multigraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph) containing \"parallel\" edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can make more sense in case we want to emphasize either some __weighting of connections__ or have __different types__ of relationships between nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the weighting of connections, there is a more straightforward method to introduce some more information, namely in the form of __connection weights__, which can represent strength or distance of a link between two nodes. The introduction of such weights forms a [weighted graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)#Weighted_graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "With regards to connections, we are at liberty to introduce different __edge types__, so as to distinguish different types of relations in a single graph dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1_rZ6rI8ZPwuE6F-zDd3sQV1m4t8MOQIo\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1nGN5PgiWSke1uSUTDxuoMnJEuTFxUAEi\" width=45%></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to the mathematically not studied, but from the database perspective significant concept of [property graphs](), in which all the nodes and edges can have additional information attached to them in the form of key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://dist.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/property_graph_elements.jpg\"><img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1r-_AQDXOTBADcaY0pDDtOOssv2OK3LZa\" width=50%></a>\n",

    "### Preliminary: Walks, Paths and trails\n",
    "\n",
    "We already hinted at it, but now is the time to more properly examine the \"change of location\" on graphs, called __traversal__.

This walk is closed if $v_1 = v_n$, and open else.\n",

    "# Graph traversal and problem solving\n",
    "\n",
    "The traversal of graphs itself is a complex problem, so for example locating a certain node or finding of the shortest or longest path between two nodes are challenges with many algorithmic solutions (some of which we will study shortly). \n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely: it is a pretty fruitful technique to use graph traversal as a problem solving technique, as we already saw earlier in the sections on search, where specific restricted graphs, namely trees were the preferred representation of a search problem, and their specialized traversal served as the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plenty of real world problems which lend themselves to be cast as graph traversal. For illustrative purposes let us dwell a bit on one - maybe the most famous.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An example: [Traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us suppose that we are a company that employs some traveling sales agents, who have the task of visiting different locations that are further or closer to each-other physically. We would like to come up with some suggestions to our agent, given the set of locations she has to visit about the shortest overall path she can take to visit all the sites. This is in essence a very __classic optimization problem__.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe, that in it's purest form, this can be studied as a graph problem, in which nodes represent locations and the weighted edges between them stand for the \"road\" distances connecting them.\n",

    "The challenge is, how can we come up with a walk that is the shortest possible and touches every node in the graph. If we find such path, we __solve an optimization problem__.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also observe, that the possible combination of paths is exponentially related to the number of nodes in the problem, so much so, that raveling salesman is considered to be [NP hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness). This makes it in practice infeasible for many non-trivial sizes, so much so, that it is customary to use some [approximate optimization algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christofides_algorithm) to make the solution of real world problems feasible. (In fact, even some deep learning [approaches](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/07/21/skynet-salesman/) were tried in this field.) \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, in 2020 a new [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01409) came out that [beat the previous long standing benchmark](https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-break-traveling-salesperson-record-20201008/) on approximate traveling salesman.\n",
